# Viv

## Status
Viv is currently in an toy stage. The code may be interesting to
read, and play with, but it cannot yet be used for even small-scale hobby
projects.

## The Idea
Viv is based on a single (dumb) idea: What if we tried to cram basically
everything into one langauge? Currently, I'm working on implementing:
+ Functional Programming
+ Imperative Programming
+ Object-Orented 
+ Concatenative Programming 
+ Logic Programming
+ Actor Based Concurrency 
+ Metaprogramming

Currently in planning are:
+ Hardware Programming (maybe)
+ Type system (Dependent)
+ Systems programming features (opt-in manual memory managment)

## Some Snippets

```viv
;; double-semicolon for comments
;; parentheses are used for most syntax and denote the functional/imperative paradigms.
;; Syntax is lisp-style 
(+ 1 2) ;; add two numbers
```
